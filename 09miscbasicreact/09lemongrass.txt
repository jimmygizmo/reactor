lemongrass is just a name chosen randomly with visions of the beauty of spring and yellow flowers on green fields.

This directory holds a React app with parts put together from earlier tutorials.

The code of interest is inside UseEffectRestBasic.js and is really rudimentary and not production appropriate,
such that onClick button events simply set string arguments to fill in a mock data api call (typicode) and then dumps
then return data. That's it.
I think I did this version as a an sort of counter-example of how it was done long ago and how not to do things now.
This leads into using React Router and a simple switch to run different component functions that each created different
data. Then the buttons no longer send parameter-setting click events, rather they are navigation buttons that go to
react router routes which then trigger the correct code based on the URL.

The context is important here. This is an example of why we want to do things like this with React Router.

TODO: I may have this demo of the better approach using switch in a private repo somewhere. Re-do that demo here
  in this repo and indicate it goes along with this demo in the 09lemongrass directory.
