https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html

starting with most basic HTML5 best practice empty starter page, add React little by little.

01basic.html - just minimum, best-practice HTML

02likebutton.html - one very simple React component added

UPDATE: The above tut is for adding react to a website and the steps are not going to be
commonly used. More like will be use of CRA, so lets skip to work and notes and tuts inside of:
/05cra

And:
https://create-react-app.dev

Then go from here. Pick up on next logical official ReactJS tut. No more random web tuts.
Too often out-dated.
