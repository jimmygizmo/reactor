Most work in this CRA project (05cra, inside repo 'reactor') will likely be a combination of the
basic React Router quick start here:
https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial

And this 5 hour React Coding Interview Prep course here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBTJDpT2XaI
-------------------------------------------

It is another good one from freeCodeCamp/org, hence the dir name: fccamp

(work done from video and with lots of custom changes along the way. this is not pasted source.)

CONCEPT: Learn more about React Router while using it to organize the separate steps and lessons of this long
tutorial. Alongn the way, other experiments and tutorial components will likely be included.
As said before, if anything gets to be too much for this CRA, a fresh CRA will be started in this 'reactor'
repo. I will try to group similar concepts, frameworks and complexity levels in an organized manner.
