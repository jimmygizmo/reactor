// This LOADER is imported in index.jsx, where this Root component is referenced.
export async function loader({ request }) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  // IMPORTANT: Logic around the value of q and the usage of the search box.
  // When the search Form is submitted (hit enter within it) it issues a GET request and uses URL params.
  // ** When root first loads, q = null.  ** Hitting enter in an empty search box gives, q = '' (nothing in log).
  // This makes sense because the search Form is ONLY submitted via enter within it. BOTH values are falsy.
  // Filtering using matchsorter() is ONLY applied for a truthy q. This is the nice simple behavior we see.
  // BUT the search box does not work perfectly in all cases. TODO: Note here how it can be improved. DONE. PARTIAL FIX.
  // 1. If you click a 'found' item, the search resets. Must search again each time you select a found item.
  //      BUT, what makes it much worse is the search terms stay in the box, yet the search has been canceled and
  //      the full contact set is shown. A partial fix would be to have the box clear, but a proper fix would
  //      be for the search results to never change based on navigation, only on a manual reset in one of two
  //      ways of the search; clear and enter OR click the x to cancel search and reset.
  // UPDATE: The tutorial identifies two problems which cover some of the above:
  // A. If you click back after a search, the form field still has the value you entered even though the list
  //    is no longer filtered.
  // B. If you refresh the page after searching, the form field no longer has the value in it,
  //    even though the list is filtered.
  const q = url.searchParams.get("q");
  console.log('LOADER: root params q: ' + q);
  const contacts = await getContacts(q);
  console.log('LOADER: root contacts: ' + JSON.stringify( contacts, null, 2 ));
  return { contacts, q };  // FIXED: q added to the return object so we can get the form in sync with the URL.
}

// This ACTION is imported in index.jsx, where the router and its routes are defined.
// index.jsx is where the callbacks to action, loader are linked up with the routes.
// It is also where THIS root Route (specifically, Root) is referenced.
// IMPORTANT: We have two Forms on this page but this action() is ONLY called by the 'new' button Form.
// Only the 'New' button Form specifies method="post".
// TODO: Clarify how role="search" and type="search" work in the search Form and its input. Do these play any role
//   in functionality of submitting or the usage of GET vs POST? Is default to use GET when no method specified?

const Root = () => {
  const loaderData = useLoaderData();
  // console.log('useLoaderData: ' + JSON.stringify( loaderData, null, 2 ));  // loaderData is just so we could see the full object returned.
  // But really, we know this came from the loader() above and from getContacts(). The format is the same.
  // CONCLUSION: useLoaderData() does not change the data returned by loader() at all.
  // Router calls loader() during navigation of routes; I guess this is pre-rendering.
  //   We might say; Elements of Routes (routes) call useLoaderData when rendering.
  const { contacts, q } = loaderData;  // { contacts, q } is just destructuring. Also, FIXED: q added for URL syncing.

      // the fact the when you open a record to view and maybe edit, the search resets. Maybe this tut never addresses
      // that issue.
