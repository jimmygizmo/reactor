Creating a new React app in /Users/bilbo/GITREPOS/reactor/05cra/mycra.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts with cra-template...
--------
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
--------

UPGRADE occasionally:
npm install react-scripts@latest

---------

This CRA will now be used in following this 5 our React Interview Prep course from freeCodeCamp.org:

If this CRA gets too cluttered, more CRAs will be created in this repo to keep this cleanly organized.
