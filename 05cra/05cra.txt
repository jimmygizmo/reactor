// PLAN: Follow react-router quick start, which is a bit different from the CRA
// I am starting with. But I will adapt all code. They use Vite and some other stuff.
// I want to just add minimal React Router to this standard CRA format. Their
// entrypoint is main.jsx. I want to try a slightly different approach just to try it.

-------------------------------------------------------------
// UPDATE: The earlier goal, stated at the end of this file, will come AFTER the above one
// and might likely be a separate app unless it makes perfect sense to continue adding pages
// using router to further that experiment.

npx create-react-app mycra

Creating a new React app in /Users/bilbo/GITREPOS/reactor/05cra/mycra.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts with cra-template...
--------
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
--------

UPGRADE occasionally:
npm install react-scripts@latest

---------

This CRA will now be used in following this 5 hour React Interview Prep course from freeCodeCamp.org:

If this CRA gets too cluttered, more CRAs will be created in this repo to keep this cleanly organized.
