1. we want our own package.json in this dir
npm init --yes

* This init process seems to have picked 01reactdom.js as our main. Not sure how it chooses but its a decent choice.

2. Install Babel
   Let's install babel and the required presets and plugins.
   npm i -D @babel/preset-react @babel/preset-env @babel/core babel-loader @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties

3. Create a babel config file .babelrc

4. Install Webpack and Webpack Dev Server
   npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin path

5. Create basic dirs and files needed:
   mkdir src public
   touch src/index.js src/App.js public/index.html

JUST FOR INTEREST, This is the package.json created by npm init:
{
  "name": "04reactdom",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "01reactdom.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


** We could rename 01reactdom.js to index.js and move in into a src .. but really, I'm not gonna do all this
manual setup. Good to see the basics of what CRA does, but will just use CRA now.

* Removing package.json created by npm init. Will now follow CRA steps from offical doc.
Will do this inside: /05cra
